<p>
 After completing the last task you will scroll to the end of the page and select the size of the
 Memory, vcpu and pricing, after selecting your size you now need to create a username and password.
</p>
 *Note* If you're using a free subscription the option that you are presented with may vary.
 Last thing needed for this page is to check the licensing box at the bottom, please beware that
 if you are using this for production on your own you will need to check if you have the license
 to use the operating system.

</p>
As you can tell by the top of this screen that there are a lot of different tabs to customize 
your Virtual Machine, if you have configurations that you want to use do so now. Unless you
understand how to configure a virtual machine its best to use the preset values presented. *Note 
most common changes that are made are to the networking tab.

The first task on this tab is to select a virtual network, your resource group you just created is the
default option the system will use unless there is another or you want to create one. The subnet
and the public ip will be created for you. If you have followed the steps you are able to press review
and create.
